# GPA Prediction using Linear Regression


## Acknowledgements

I would like to extend our sincere thanks to Ruturaj Sanap for his invaluable contribution to building the multiple linear regression model for this project. His efforts in analyzing the data, selecting the appropriate features, and applying statistical methods to create a robust model were instrumental in the success of this project.

Through his work, we were able to develop a predictive model that accurately captures the relationships between multiple independent variables and the target variable, significantly improving our ability to make reliable predictions. His deep understanding of regression analysis and data preprocessing helped in delivering a model that is both efficient and effective.


## Deployment

The project has been successfully deployed on Render, a popular cloud hosting platform known for its simplicity and ability to deploy web applications seamlessly. The deployment process involved hosting a Streamlit application, which is a Python framework designed for creating data-driven applications with ease.

```bash
 streamlit run frontend/app.py
```
